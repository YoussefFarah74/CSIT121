Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Pour half of the the BBQ sauce into a large bowl, add the seasoned chicken pieces and toss to coat. Spread the chicken out on a baking tray and roast for 1 hr, occasionally basting with more BBQ sauce, until the chicken is cooked through and sticky.

BBQ chicken platters are my favorite recipe because they are so easy to make and they taste great. I love how the chicken comes out so juicy and flavorful, and the platters always look so pretty when they're finished. @ <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/bbq-chicken-platter">bbcgoodfood </a> serves have it all. Enjoy.
